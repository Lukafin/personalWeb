I’m happy to share that the Health Research Companion now has an iOS beta. You can find more details in my [previous update](/health/2025/09/21/introducing-my-ai-health-research-companion.html).

I’m inviting iPhone users to join the first TestFlight cohort. The beta reflects the steady improvements I’ve been working on recently, and I’d love to hear how it fits into your day.

If you’d like to try it, just drop me a DM and I’ll send over an invite link. I’m eager to receive feedback.
