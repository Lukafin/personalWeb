In my free time I’ve been working on something that started from a very personal need as a parent. Over the years I’ve collected stacks of paper diagnoses (MR, CT scans, lab results), often written in complex language that’s difficult to interpret. I felt AI could be a perfect fit to make this easier.

The main motivation came from my daughter’s journey with atopic dermatitis. After you receive a diagnosis with “no cure,” doctors usually stop searching for new treatments or dietary options. But I kept looking into medical journals myself, surfacing possible new therapies or lifestyle adjustments.

That’s the idea behind the app: it helps users find promising research and options they can then discuss with their doctor—the doctor remains the one who decides if something makes sense in each case.

On top of that, inspired by how much I enjoy NotebookLM, I added podcasts: hosts discussing your diagnosis in simple terms, plus a short "radio news" style segment highlighting recent research.

The app is available on Android via Firebase App Testing (not yet in the Play Store), with iOS coming soon. Friends who are testing it already find it useful, and I'd love to get more feedback—so if you'd like to try it, feel free to reach out!
